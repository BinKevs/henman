                The Author has had two distinct careers before entering
                full-time writing in 2012. While in college he started a
                twenty-year period, first as a youth counselor and then as
                certified, clinical Marriage & Family Therapist. He then entered
                the business world for the next twenty-years, first as an owner
                and manager of a supply business for Cabinet Makers and
                Furniture Refinishers and then representing clients in
                residential Real Estate as well as re-modeling houses and
                re-selling them.

                Since Oct. 2016, he has lost fifty-five pounds and survived a
                five-way, open-heart surgery in Oct. 2019. He has recovered
                beautifully and stays physically active. Since he was a
                youngster, he has played many different sports and followed
                fervently, DC area professional sports & UMD teams. He attended
                his first professional sports game in 1961 at Griffith Stadium
                in DC, watching the eventual World Series Champion, NY Yankees,
                with Mickey Mantle & Roger Maris. The Senators won 4-1.
                <br />
                <br />
                He has spent parts of the past eight winters in their condo on
                the beach in Cape Canaveral, Florida walking on the sand,
                swimming in the ocean, watching the occasional Space X
                lift-offs. Each day finding inspiration seeing the sun rising,
                hearing the crashing waves, feeling the storms rolling through
                and smelling the night air as the moon crosses the sky.
